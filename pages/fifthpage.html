            Role in the film
            In the beginning, when Oliver is left all alone and his box home is ruined, Oliver 
            tries to find shelter in an alley, only to find three vicious alley dogs searching for 
            food. When the alley dogs spot Oliver, they begin to chase him, so as to eat him. 
            Luckily, Oliver escapes by jumping over a fence while the dogs remain behind the fence.
            They aren't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this until somewhere in the 
            climax when Oliver is with his dog friends singing Streets of Gold, another vicious 
            alley dog jumps into the scene and chases Oliver until he is scared off by Dodger and 
            the gang's growling and runs away like a yellow cowardly dog. He isn't seen throughout 
            the rest of the movie after this.
